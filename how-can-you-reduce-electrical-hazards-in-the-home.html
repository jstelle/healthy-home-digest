However, there are many other hazards associated with electricity that can also be dangerous. Reducing these hazards will not only help you avoid potentially expensive damage to your home, but it will also help you avoid getting into trouble with your power company. There are many things you can do to reduce electrical hazards in your home. Here is a list of some ideas on how you can avoid these hazards and keep your home safe from electrical fires and damage:</p><h2>Change your light bulbs</h2><p>Light bulbs can account for a large percentage of electrical hazards in your home. It is recommended to change all light bulbs in the home every few years to reduce the risk of an electrical fire. Changing your light bulbs will also help you save money by extending the lifespan of the bulbs. You should also make sure to turn off lights when they are not in use to prevent them from overheating and causing a fire. Finally, you should avoid using extension cords or power adapters that are not designed for indoor use. These can overheat and cause a fire.</p><h2>Install GFCI outlets and switches</h2><p>If you want to reduce the risk of electrical shock, you should install GFCI outlets and switches. GFCI stands for Ground-fault circuit-interruption, which are devices that are designed to protect you from electrical hazards. They will trip when there is a hazard and prevent you from getting an electrical shock. GFCI outlets and switches are required in bathrooms, kitchens and outdoor locations where there is a risk of water or gas getting into the electrical system. They are also used in locations where people may be working with heavy machinery.</p><h2>Protect outdoor wiring</h2><p>If you have outdoor wiring, you should protect it from the elements. This will help prevent water and moisture from causing an electrical fire. You can do this by using weatherproof covers or conduit. Another option is to bury your wires if soil conditions will allow it. This will make it harder for rodents and other pests to get to the wires and cause an electrical fire.</p><h2>Donâ€™t use extension cords</h2><p>One of the most common ways to reduce electrical hazards is to not use extension cords. However, you should still be careful when plugging in appliances. Make sure to plug appliances into the correct outlets and turn off the power before working on a project. You should also avoid using extension cords with frayed or broken wires. Frayed wires can overheat and cause a fire.</p><h2>Install proper GFCI breakers</h2><p>If you have a large home, you may want to consider installing a GFCI breaker panel. This will allow you to plug in appliances without having to worry about tripping breakers. GFCI breakers are designed to protect you from electrical hazards. They are commonly used in kitchens, bathrooms and outdoor locations where there is a risk of water or gas getting into the electrical system. GFCI breakers are also used in locations where people may be working with heavy machinery.</p><h2>Donâ€™t run wires through walls or attics</h2><p>Wires can be a common cause of electrical fires. If you want to avoid this, you should not run wires through walls or attics. This will help you avoid accidentally coming into contact with the wires or bringing them into contact with a nail or other sharp object. If you must run wires through walls or attics, you should use conduit to protect them.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Electrical hazards in the home can be dangerous. Reducing these hazards will not only help you avoid potentially expensive damage to your home, but it will also help you avoid getting into trouble with your power company. There are many things you can do to reduce electrical hazards in your home. Here is a list of some ideas on how you can avoid these hazards and keep your home safe from electrical fires and damage.</p>

                                            <p>Pollutants come in many forms. The most common type of pollution is from the air we breathe and the water we drink.
