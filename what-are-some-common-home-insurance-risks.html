                                                                                                    <p>Home insurance covers damage to your home, its contents, and your belongings in the event of a loss. The type and amount of coverage you need will depend on your personal circumstances and risk tolerance. If you purchase less coverage than you need, youâ€™ll save money now but risk running out of money to make repairs if disaster strikes. If you overbuy, on the other hand, youâ€™ll pay higher premiums but wonâ€™t run out of money to repair damage. Here are some common home insurance risks to help you determine how much coverage you need:</p><h2>Fire and Lightning</h2><p>The cost of rebuilding a home after a fire is about $100,000 on average, according to the Insurance Information Institute. The average cost of replacing contents is about $30,000. If your home is located in an area with a high risk of fire, you may want to consider increasing your coverage to account for the higher replacement cost. If thereâ€™s been a recent change in your neighborhood such as new construction or a nearby wildfire, you may want to increase your coverage based on those circumstances.</p><h2>Burglary</h2><p>The average cost of repairing a burglary is about $32,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute. The average cost of replacing stolen items is about $9,000. If your home is located in a high-risk area for burglary, you may want to increase your coverage. If your home is in an area with a high crime rate, you may also want to consider increasing your coverage to account for the higher risk of burglary.</p><h2>Water Damage</h2><p>The average cost of repairing a water-related disaster is about $32,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute. The average cost of replacing damaged items is about $9,000. If your home is located in a high-risk area for water damage, you may want to increase your coverage. If your home is in an area with a high chance of water damage, you may also want to consider increasing your coverage to account for the higher risk of flooding.</p><h2>Moss Growth and Infestation</h2><p>The average cost of repairing a moss or insect infestation is about $32,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute. The average cost of replacing damaged items is about $9,000. If your home is located in a high-risk area for moss or insect infestations, you may want to increase your coverage. If your home is in an area with a high chance of moss or insect damage, you may also want to consider increasing your coverage to account for the higher risk of infestation.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Home insurance is designed to protect your home and its contents from a variety of possible perils. The cost of rebuilding or replacing your home can be very high, so itâ€™s important to choose the right amount of coverage. Itâ€™s important to understand the different types of coverage and what each one does so that you can make the most informed decision when purchasing a policy. If you want to make sure you have the right amount of coverage, contact an agent today.</p>

                                            <p>Pollutants come in many forms. The most common type of pollution is from the air we breathe and the water we drink.
