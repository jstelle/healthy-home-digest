                                                                                                    <p>A healthy home is one thatâ€™s a sanctuary for you and your family. Itâ€™s a place where you can rest, relax, and recharge after a long day. A home filled with nature sounds and natural light can help you unwind after a long day at work or an exhausting week at school. A home thatâ€™s healthy also has features that support your health and well-being, like air flow, humidity levels, and indoor plants. Building or buying a new home? Make sure you consider these six components when designing or buying a home:</p><h2>Lighting</h2><p>Lighting is one of the most important factors in creating a healthy home. Natural light is crucial to our well-being, helping us to sleep better, feel more alert, and reduce our risk of eye strain. And, artificial light can actually disrupt our circadian rhythm, making it harder to fall asleep at night.When designing a home, look at how the light is distributed throughout the space and how much natural light is let in from the windows.You should also consider how you want to use the space and what type of lighting will be most effective. For example, if youâ€™re reading a book in the living room, you might want to dim the lights to allow you to read comfortably without having to squint.</p><h2>Air flow</h2><p>Air flow in a home is important for a couple of reasons. First, it helps to prevent the growth of mould and mildew, which can be a problem in humid climates. Second, it helps to reduce the risk of static electricity build-up, which can be a hazard in dry climates. Ideally, you want to create a balanced flow of air in your home. You can achieve this by opening windows when the weather is nice and keeping them closed when itâ€™s chilly. You can also use an air purifier to remove dust and other pollutants from the air. A healthy home is not one without plants. Plants clean the air of toxins and produce oxygen. They also help to create a pleasant smell in a home.</p><h2>Humidity</h2><p>Humidity is important for your health and comfort. It can also help to prevent static electricity build-up. You can help to create humidity in your home by opening the windows and using an indoor humidifier. If your home is too dry, you can also buy a humidifier for your air conditioner.Too much humidity can be uncomfortable, so itâ€™s important to monitor the humidity level in your home. Too little humidity can cause your skin to dry out and crack, while too much can lead to condensation on windows and other condensation-related problems.</p><h2>Thermal Comfort</h2><p>Thermal comfort is the level of heat in your home that you feel comfortable with. You can measure the thermal comfort of your home with a thermostat. Ideally, you want to maintain a temperature of around 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit). If your home is too cold, you can use a blanket or throw a few extra layers of clothing in the dryer. If itâ€™s too warm, you can open the windows or use a fan to bring in cooler air.Too much heat can be uncomfortable, so itâ€™s important to monitor the temperature in your home. Ideally, you want to maintain a temperature of around 18 degrees Celsius (64 degrees Fahrenheit). If your home is too cold, you can use a blanket or throw a few extra layers of clothing in the dryer. If itâ€™s too warm, you can open the windows or use a fan to bring in cooler air.</p><h2>Air quality</h2><p>Air quality refers to the quality of the air in your home. This can be measured using a device called a Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) sensor. Ideally, you want to keep the VOC level in your home below 10 parts per million.If you have pets or young children, you may want to increase this number. If you have a chronic illness like asthma or allergies, you may want to keep the VOC level as low as possible.You can also use a portable air purifier to improve the quality of the air in your home. Air purifiers can help to remove harmful particles from the air, like dust and pet dander.</p><h2>Natural materials</h2><p>Natural materials, like wood, stone, and wool, are great for a home. Theyâ€™re long-lasting, they donâ€™t off-gas, and theyâ€™re easy to clean. When it comes to decorating your home, you have a lot of options. You can purchase furniture and other decor items made from natural materials, or you can repurpose items you have at home.For example, you can repurpose old blankets and pillows to make a new couch cover or rug. You can also repurpose old wooden crates to store your shoes. Natural materials are great for a healthy home because theyâ€™re easy to clean, durable, and long-lasting.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Building or buying a new home? Make sure you consider these six components when designing or buying a home. A healthy home is a sanctuary for you and your family. Itâ€™s a place where you can rest, relax, and recharge after a long day. A home thatâ€™s healthy also has features that support your health and well-being, like air flow, humidity levels, and indoor plants. Your home can be a place of comfort, support, and relaxation.</p>

                                            <p>Pollutants come in many forms. The most common type of pollution is from the air we breathe and the water we drink. If these two get severely contaminated, diseases will spread affecting every home. It is important to start promoting good hygiene within ourselves and be mindful of our surroundings for our community.</p>
